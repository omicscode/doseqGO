# doseqGO

- a concurrent sequence information knowledge graph for long read sequencing projects
- plant or microbial genome sequencing
- it provides the following:
  1. Sequence information search from the assembled sequences.
  2. Annotation search from the assembled sequences.
  3. Pangenome graph view from the sam files from the Pangenome alignment.
- added a SVA single page application concurrent golang, javascript for browsing your VCF files.
- No installation needed, just put your VCF files into the folder and analyze them for your variants.

Fascinating all from sequencing to the variants with the power of the GO concurrency and all in one information place.
